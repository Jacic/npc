{"name":"#NoPotatoCompo","tagline":"when potatoes take over Ludum Dare...","body":"# Welcome, my dear friend.\r\n**This is the official site of #NoPotatoCompo, a game jam created by @michcioperz and @Jacic (IamJacic on Twitter) as part of the #MeatUprising which happened when half a #LD48 theme voters began to think Potato is a good theme.**\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Game Jam Rules\r\n1. No potatoes in game.\r\n2. At least one potato in game's name.\r\n3. We challenge you to add some meat to your game. In case you consider meat itself not enough for your \"dinner\", rice is our featured potatoes replacement.\r\n4. Make a game in 48 hours.\r\n\r\nIf these rules are too simple for you, add [Ludum Dare rules](http://ludumdare.com/compo/rules).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Communication during the Jam\r\nWe registered [#NPC at irc.afternet.org](https://www.afternet.org/qwebirc/?channels=NPC). If you had any better ideas, add them to the issue tracker of this repo.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Submissions\r\n@michcioperz is busy working on a WordPress-based submissions system. It should be ready before Friday, or even earlier.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Good luck!\r\nThanks for participating in this artists don't need descriptions project team activity.","google":"UA-37762022-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
